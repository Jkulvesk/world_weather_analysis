# world_weather_analysis

## Overview
This challenge had us use two different APIs - google maps and the openweathermap API to plot ideal cities that people want to travel based on their weather preferences. We then found the nearest hotels to these cities and then mapped an itinerary for four cities with directions and markers of the city points.

The main files with the outputs include the Vacation_Search.ipynb and Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb files.
